-BUG: can't type spaces in textboxes!
-only allow one item to be selected at a time
-unhandled exception, null reference on unindent clicked
-unspecified error on indenting item that contains children
-when textbox selected, change hiearchicalListView's selected item to select the item underlying the textbox
-change checkboxes back to togglebuttons, and add complete button to appbar
-switch out existing indentation functionality to drag-drop interface, i.e. dragging items onto another item adds them as children of this item
-marking item as complete/incomplete also marks it's children as complete/incomplete
-add moving up/down in list functionality, idealy using drag-drop interface
-clicking on blank area of window unselects all items
