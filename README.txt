Sublist is a Windows 10 app to organize your life into a simple list of entries which are ordered into heirarchical categories and subcategories. Keep track of all your notes, ideas, tasks, goals, reminders, etc. in one easily accessible, intuitive, well ordered master list.

To run the project:
Install the SQLite for Visual Studio 2015 first. It is filed in extras/plugins/sqlite-uap-3081101.vsix.

Features: 
  -Mark entries as completed 
  -Hide/unhide completed notes 
  -Expand/contract a note's subcategories (in development) 
  -Search entire list for keywords (in development) 
  -Password protected (in development) 
  -Encrypted local storage (in development) 
  -Sync across devices (in development)

Just started working on it, so it's not much yet. Any thoughts are welcome, expecially if they're in XAML and/or C# format!
